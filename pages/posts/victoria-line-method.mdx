## Everybody's got too much to do.

Everybody's busy. It's the way of the modern world &mdash; perpetual growth, continuous access to new information &mdash; your to-do list is infinite now whether you like it or not. Nowhere do I find this to be more true than in my job, where I run a team that moves faster than most are comfortable with<sup>1</sup>.

If you're new here, I run an engineering team that follows Octopus Energy's marketing department so closely that our priorities sometimes change by the hour, let alone the day. It's unorthodox for software engineering, where two-week "sprints" are common, but there is method in the madness.

You see, being a utility, we're building something that's in our customer's pocket, in a cupboard under their stairs, and usually in their inbox once a month too. You have to engage with folks if you expect them to do the same back, and that means moving with them - whether it's having the answers ready when the price cap hits headlines, being empathetic when it comes to payments in a cost of living crisis, or using  that presence in your customers' lives to bring a little joy to their day.

Of course, it's Octopus' customer service agents that do this work first and foremost, but it's essential that the digital products match that experience to give it authenticity. And I'm not saying we get it right all the time - far from it - but hopefully this paints a picture of the remit we have, and the things that literally keep me up at night.


<em style={{ fontSize: '.8rem', lineHeight: '.4rem' }}>[1] When hiring, my team runs a dedicated job description compared to the wider department, as the appetite for change, or "chaos" as we call it, is something many prefer to avoid. Equally, some thrive on it, and its those folks we seek to find.</em>

## So, where to start?
The biggest source of stress in my work is simply that there are too many things to do at a time. My team is a cabal of capable generalists, and has a great deal of autonomy to seek out the work that will have the greatest overall impact on our goals. This often means making difficult decisions about what we can do, for whom, and when.

[Examples]

Sometimes those decisions are easy: a third-party deadline, an industry requirement like regulation, or simply that somebody senior says so. Other times, it's not so clear cut, and it's a skill we've learned to hone and to share over time.

## Mind the gap
<em>[full circle - that's what i do]</em>

## It works, except when it doesn't
<em>[nobody's perfect - that's why it's hard]</em>
