Life in 2023 is loud. Omnipresent news feeds remind us that the world is on fire (figuratively and literally), social media competes for our attention, haranguing us to engage, and as technology allows for more and more data to be measured, everything becomes a metric. Have you closed your rings today? In this series of short musings, I&apos;ll cover how I keep myself grounded in a demanding and chaotic job, and the value I&apos;ve found in those learnings beyond the workplace. With any luck, you&apos;ll come across something to try out for yourself too!

I work in web development at Octopus Energy - global EnTech pioneer and Britain&apos;s third biggest energy supplier - and I&apos;m known, to my colleagues, as the Chaos Monkey. In fact, my has grown to include leading a small team of such humans, as well as exporting the idea of the chaos monkey to our equivalent teams overseas. It resembles the role I&apos;ve built around myself in a little over 3 years at the company, which consists of responding to small, high-priority, short-notice work requests. For us, as front-end developers, that usually looks like marketing campaigns, changes in response to customer feedback, technical maintenance and the like. The value to the team, if you can find someone willing to spin plates in such a way, is that your teammates remain free to focus on larger, more focused, in-depth projects without distraction.

Different to many of my colleagues, my to-do list shapeshifts from day to day, and I am my own project manager. Work that doesn&apos;t sit within the remit of a specialist team - or that would disrupt the progress of existing important projects - lands on my desk. We call this kind of work “chaos”, and the people who do it “chaos monkeys”.

So, how do I maintain some semblance of stability and peace in a job that tempts burn-out more than most, and, in a world that&apos;s intent on denying us rest at any opportunity, how have I used these same ideas to be restful at home and beyond? I&apos;m so glad you asked.

It&apos;s taken me most of my tenure thus far to find my way towards a balance that&apos;s sustainable, and I&apos;m certainly still doing so, but here I&apos;ve collated four principles for keeping your head on straight in a busy work environment. Each of these takes a step further back into the bigger picture of achieving balance and contending with chaos, inside the office and out.

## 1. Reduce

The most powerful thing you can do to manage the information coming towards you is to reduce it. An inbox with 50,000 unread emails (I&apos;ve seen it) will not serve you well. In all likelihood, it will cause you a sense of being overwhelmed each time you look at it. For a healthy relationship with the emails, messages, and notifications that matter, you need to do away with the ones that don&apos;t.

Tackle emails both in your personal and work lives by unsubscribing from newsletters you never really wanted anyway, but also consider turning off social notifications that aren&apos;t actionable (e.g. a friend&apos;s direct message vs a LinkedIn profile view, or worse: popular reels), and ask yourself whether something is useful each time you&apos;re alerted.

  Look at your phone&apos;s notification tray now. Remove any noise or unhelpful
  notifications for good by unsubscribing, changing app settings, or just
  removing that app&apos;s permission to notify you altogether.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="blue">
  Look at your email inbox. Unsubscribe from anything in the first 20 emails
  that you don&apos;t need. This is a better investment in time than just
  flicking through those emails.

  If you have a runaway inbox, the above steps will slow the problem, but you
  can make a sizeable dent in your unread count using filters. Gmail implements
  this well, where you can search for{" "}
  <strong>from:linkedin &ldquo;noticed&rdquo;</strong> to see a whole backlog of
  emails that are guaranteed to have no value to you.
</Callout>

Of course, some would make the argument that anything <strong>from:linkedin</strong> by definition has no value.

The key here is to limit the flow of this low-value information, so you can better manage what still gets through. It&apos;s one thing to burn down an email inbox, but think about these actions as deleting the emails (or notifications, or whatever) that you haven&apos;t received yet. A stale inbox is a lost cause, invest the time in your future instead, and a more manageable situation will become clear with time.

It&apos;s worth noting also that, depending on how you prefer to work, you may find it more appealing to allot an hour or two and tackle this kind of problem from top to bottom, or you might prefer an incremental approach where you train yourself to ask “is this valuable to me?” each time you open a new piece of information. There&apos;s no right answer here, you have to find through practice which method works best for you.
